# Superhero API
[Link to our project](https://j1lin0101.shinyapps.io/superhero-API/)

## Our Dataset
We worked with the **Superhero API**. This API is a quantified and programmatically
accessible data source of all superheroes from different comic universes. Theyâ€™ve taken
all the stuff and put it together in a form that is easier to consume with software. The
data is accessible through a **REST API**. A Facebook account to get your access token the link
to the API is https://superheroapi.com. The R packages used for this project were: *shiny*, *plotly*
*collapsibleTree*, *shinythemes*, *leaflet*, *ggplot2*, and *dplyr*. These allowed us to build beauitful and
interactive plots and diagrams throughout our pages.

## Target Audience
Our target audience are comic book fans and anyone who is a fan of superheroes and villains, and just want to know more about them. We hope to help aspiring superheroes and villains in preparing them on their journey in becoming a hero / villian. Our audience is interested in learning everything about superheros, such as how they compare against each other and where they are found. We want to help our audience understand what it takes to be a superhero

## What We Want to Teach our Audience

Our audience wants to learn what it takes to become a superhero. We will address: 

### Female Hero Scatterplot
This plot displays plots that *compare female heroes with their strength and intelligence levels.*
You can search for a hero and identify where they lie on the plot and adjust the range of hero
strength. Hovering over the Intelligence vs. Strength points will show the name of the Hero, alignment
strength, and intelligence. You can also pick a plot by alignment which displays the Strength vs
Intelligence for that alignment. These plots help identify which female heroes are most strong and
intelligent.

### Heroes and Their Connections
We wanted to make sure our audience was able to understand *the context of the lives these heroes live.*
For that reason, we created a collapsible tree which allows the visualization of the organizations
and people that these heroes are associated with. There is a selection bar for the hero and the tree can
be collapsed to reveal the people.

### Power Comparison
A natural question someone might have when thinking about superheroes has to do with the *comparison of powers from different heroes*. Thus, we created a histogram that displays various aspects of a hero and
allows users to select two heroes that they want to compare.

### Hero Birthplace Map
*Where do the heroes that we admire so much come from?* This visualization represents points that the
heroes were born in within the United States. Each point on the map show the birthplace of a hero,
hovering over the data points will reveal the Name, Full Name, Place of Birth, and Publisher of the hero.
You can select a publisher which will show heroes produced by the publisher selected.
