# Superhero API
## Our Dataset
We will be working with the **Superhero API**. This API is a quantified and programatically accessible data source of all superheroes from different comic universes. Theyâ€™ve taken all the stuff and put it together in a form that is easier to consume with software. The data is accessible through a **REST API**. A Facebook account to get your access token

## Target Audience
Our target audience are comic book fans and anyone who is a fan of superheroes and villains, and just want to know more about them. We hope to help aspiring superheroes and villains in preparing them on their journey in becoming a hero / villian. Our audience is interested in learning everything about superheros, such as how they compare against each other and where they are found. We want to help our audience understand what it takes to be a superhero

## What We Want to Teach our Audience
Our audience wants to learn what it takes to become a superhero. We will address: 
- Mapping out each of the superhero and villain organization headquarters/ base to find out where most heroes / villians are mostly stationed, and where is the best place to be a superhero. 
- We will compare different heroes and villains with their power stats and abilities to see which hero / villain would win. This would help our audience understand which powers are the strongest and weakest, and what kind of abilities are best against other types of abilities. 
- Superheroes and villains have many organizations and affiliations. 

## Libraries
- **Leaflet**: creating interactive maps 
- **GGPlot2**: creating visual representations of the different relationships between characters, organizations, and powers

## Major Problems
- Parseing through data
- Merge Conflicts
- Learning to create each specific visualization without much experience in each library
