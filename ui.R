      Our audience wants to learn what it takes to become a superhero. We will address:
      Mapping out each of the superhero and villain organization headquarters/ base to find out where most heroes / villians are mostly stationed, and where is the best place to be a superhero.
      We will compare different heroes and villains with their power stats and abilities to see which hero / villain would win. This would help our audience understand which powers are the strongest and weakest, and what kind of abilities are best against other types of abilities.
      Superheroes and villains have many organizations and affiliations.")
